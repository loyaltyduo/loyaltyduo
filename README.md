<p>don't interact with me if you're under thirteen please. and if you ever plan on talking to me, just know that i'm adhdtistic so it will most likely affect how we interact if you choose not to be careful. sorry if i come off as stand-offish at all. i just copypasted this from my main to maximize efficiency. and for my personality check... just know that c!kenadian is so insanely mecore. i hope i won't disappoint you!</p>
